# ILLUMISENSE: Ambient Light-Aware Brightness

## Introduction

Welcome to IllumiSense, a cutting-edge project designed to enhance your lifestyle through automatic light sensing technology. This project aims to create a more convenient and energy-efficient lighting experience by detecting human presence and adjusting brightness based on natural light conditions.

## Ideation

The inspiration for IllumiSense came from observing energy wastage in public places like ATMs. By integrating motion sensors and timers, we can reduce electricity consumption by turning off lights and fans when not in use.

## Components

### Sensors

1. **LDR Sensor (Light Dependent Resistor):**
   - Monitors natural light intensity.
   - Adjusts LED brightness accordingly.

2. **Motion Sensor:**
   - Detects movement.
   - Turns the light on/off based on detected motion.

### Hardware

1. **Jumper Wires:**
   - Connects various components without soldering.

2. **Arduino Uno Board:**
   - Microcontroller for data processing.
   - Reads data from sensors and controls LED.

3. **LED Lights:**
   - Energy-efficient lighting source.

## Our Approach

In this microcontroller-based project, we utilize an Arduino Uno, LDR sensor, motion sensor, and LED lights. The Arduino Uno processes data from the sensors and controls the LED based on detected motion and ambient light.

## Advantages

1. **Daylight Harvesting:**
   - Automatically adjusts electric lighting based on available daylight.
   
2. **Dual Detection:**
   - Detects both motion and changes in brightness.

## How Can We Improve?

We can enhance the project by incorporating ultrasonic sensors instead of infrared sensors. Ultrasonic sensors offer a longer range, are sensitive to all types of motion, and eliminate coverage gaps.
